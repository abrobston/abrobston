I'm a full-stack software developer and team lead. I have worked mostly in .NET frameworks lately, with an increasing amount of TypeScript. My recent colleagues would tell you I specialize in:

- Microsoft SQL Server performance
- Technical mentorship and leadership
- Business decision-making
- AWS cloud architecture

My biggest open-source project is [JS/CC](https://github.com/abrobston/jscc), which isn't originally mine.  Rather, I adapted an existing project to run on Node, among other updates.

I work remotely from my home in rural Minnesota.
