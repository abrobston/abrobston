I'm a full-stack software developer and team lead, with an enthusiasm for helping others learn and grow in their careers. I have worked mostly on full-stack TypeScript applications lately, especially the data-intensive parts. I spent more time in .NET frameworks before that. My recent colleagues would tell you I specialize in:

- Database performance, particularly with Microsoft SQL Server
- Technical mentorship and leadership
- Business decision-making
- AWS cloud architecture

My biggest open-source project is [JS/CC](https://github.com/abrobston/jscc), which isn't originally mine.  Rather, I adapted an existing project to run on Node, among other updates.

I work remotely from my home in rural Minnesota.
